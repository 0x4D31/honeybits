Hi,

Ah, sorry I forgot to send you the new address: http://%s
I also reset your password (user: %s) to the default pass: %s

Please set the MFA (multi-factor authentication) ASAP.

Cheers,

Hi Adel,

I just wanted to login to the Monitoring system, but I get 404 error. Could you please have a look at it?

Thanks
Dave
